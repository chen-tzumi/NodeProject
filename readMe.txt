# Node.js User and Card Management API

## Project Overview
This Node.js project provides an API for managing users and business cards. The application starts with three initial users
and three initial cards. It includes authentication, authorization, and admin functionalities.
Additionally, the project implements three bonus features: 
an admin can change a business number, a file logger records errors 
and users are blocked for 24hurs after 3 failed login attempts .

## Admin's info can be found in the initial users data


## Attention! Existing Users
Please note that the three existing users are as follows: an Admin user (only), a Business user (only), and a Regular user (who is neither a Business nor an Admin user). Kindly take this into consideration when testing the project, as well as the corresponding middleware configurations.


This page includes a brief description of the available API endpoints for users and cards, along with links to the full documentation.
